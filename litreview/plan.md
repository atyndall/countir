### Taxonomy of sensing - teixeira2010survey
* Presence — Is there at least one person present?
* Count — How many people are present?
* Location — Where is each person?
* Track — Where was this person before?
* Identity — Who is each person? Is this person John?

### Sensing 
* using the taxonomy of measurable human traits teixeira2010survey
  
* Intrinsic traits
  * Static 
    * Thermal - erickson2013thermosense
    * CO2 - fisk2006accuracy, hailemariam2011real
    * Video - erickson2013poem, serrano2013efficient
  * Dynamic
    * Ultrasonic - hnat2012doorjamb
    * PIR - erickson2013thermosense, hailemariam2011real

* Extrinsic traits
  * Instrumented
    * Smart phones - kleiminger2013using
    * RFID - scott2011preheat
    * GPS - gupta2009adding
  * Correlative
    * Electricity consumption - kleiminger2013occupancy
    * Network traffic - ting2013occupancy

* Fusions of the above don't necessarily work better - hailemariam2011real

### Thermal sensors
* Thermosense
  
### Architecture
