\chapter{Literature Review}
 
As discussed in the Introduction, broadly, my research question involves investigating occupancy solutions for the ``smart home for the disabled concept''. These solutions will be compared against the aforementioned accessibility critera of low cost, non-invasiveness, energy efficiency and reliability.

The area of occupancy has seen a great deal of recent research due to the popularisation of embedded platforms, and their subsequent reduction in cost.
